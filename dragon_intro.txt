ðŸ”¥ THE ANCIENT DRAGON ðŸ”¥

Before you stands a creature of legend - a dragon so ancient that it has forgotten its own name. Its scales are black as night and harder than diamond, its eyes burn with the fires of a thousand suns, and its wings span the entire chamber.

This is no ordinary dragon. This is the Eternal One, the Guardian of the Castle, the Unconquerable Flame. It has watched kingdoms rise and fall, has seen countless heroes come and go, and has never once been defeated.

The dragon regards you with ancient wisdom, its massive head tilting slightly as it studies you. "Another mortal seeking glory," it rumbles, its voice shaking the very foundations of the castle. "How many of you must I destroy before you learn that some battles cannot be won?"

The air crackles with magical energy as the dragon prepares to demonstrate why it has remained undefeated for millennia. Its power is absolute, its strength unmatched, and its determination unshakeable.

You may have come prepared for battle, but you are not prepared for this...
