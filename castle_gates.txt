🏰 CASTLE GATES 🏰

The ancient stone walls of Castle Dragonreach loom before you, their weathered surface telling tales of countless battles. The massive iron gates stand partially open, creaking ominously in the wind.

As you approach, you notice strange runes carved into the stone - ancient magic that seems to pulse with a faint, malevolent energy. The air is thick with anticipation, and somewhere deep within the castle, you hear the distant sound of something... breathing.

A weathered sign hangs crookedly from the gate:
"Enter if you dare, but know this: 
The dragon within is eternal.
None who face it shall return."

Your heart pounds with both fear and excitement. This is what you've trained for - the ultimate test of your courage and skill.

The gates beckon you forward into the unknown...
