🏰 THE DUNGEON 🏰

Descending into the castle's depths, you find yourself in a maze of dark corridors and empty cells. The air is thick with the stench of despair and something else - something ancient and powerful that makes your skin crawl.

The walls are lined with rusted chains and manacles, and in some cells, you find the remains of previous adventurers. Their equipment lies scattered about - swords, armor, and magical items that proved useless against the dragon above.

As you navigate the labyrinthine passages, you begin to understand the true nature of this place. This isn't just a dungeon - it's a trap, designed to wear down the spirits of those who would challenge the dragon's rule.

Every turn seems to lead you deeper into the castle's heart, and with each step, you feel the weight of countless failed attempts pressing down on you. The dragon has been here for centuries, and it has learned to make its lair impregnable.

The path ahead leads upward, toward the tower where the dragon awaits...
