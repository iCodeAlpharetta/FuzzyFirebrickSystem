üè∞ THE DRAGON'S TOWER üè∞

You emerge from the dungeon into a massive circular chamber at the base of the central tower. The walls are lined with ancient tapestries depicting the dragon's reign of terror, and the floor is covered in a thick layer of ash and soot.

The air is hot and thick with the smell of sulfur and burning flesh. Above you, the tower stretches impossibly high, its stone walls glowing with an otherworldly light that seems to pulse in time with your heartbeat.

As you look around, you notice that every surface is covered in the same runes you saw at the castle gates. They glow brighter now, as if responding to your presence. The magic here is ancient and powerful - it's been building for centuries, waiting for the next challenger.

A voice echoes through the chamber, deep and resonant, speaking in a language you don't understand but somehow comprehend: "Welcome, mortal. You have come far, but your journey ends here. I am eternal, and you are but a fleeting moment in time."

The dragon knows you're here. It's been expecting you. And it's ready to prove once and for all that some legends are meant to remain undefeated...
