üè∞ THE COURTYARD üè∞

You step into a vast courtyard that was once the heart of a thriving castle. Now, it lies in ruins - broken stone benches, toppled statues, and the charred remains of what might have been a beautiful garden.

In the center of the courtyard stands a massive fountain, its waters long since dried up. The stone dragon at its center seems to watch you with lifeless eyes that somehow still hold ancient wisdom.

As you walk through the debris, you notice something peculiar: every path, every broken archway, every fallen column seems to point toward the central tower. It's as if the castle itself is designed to funnel visitors toward their doom.

The wind carries whispers of past adventurers who came before you - their voices seem to echo through the stone, warning you of what lies ahead. But you press on, your determination outweighing the growing sense of dread.

The central tower looms ever closer, its dark windows like hollow eyes watching your approach...
